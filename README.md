# Jazz Serverless Platform
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tmobile/jazz.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tmobile/jazz)

**Seamlessly build, deploy & manage cloud-native applications.**

Jazz accelerates adoption of serverless services. Jazz comes with a UI that lets developers quickly create serverless services with the click of a button. Its modular design makes it easy to add new integrations:

* **Services** - Jazz can help build functions, APIs and static websites. The template-based system makes it easy to define new ones.
* **Deployment Targets** - Currently we deploy to AWS (Lambda, API gateway and S3). We plan to support Azure Functions and Docker containers in the near future.
* **Features** - Services seamlessly integrate features like monitoring (CloudWatch), logging (ElasticSearch), authentication (Cognito).
* **Deployment & CI/CD** - CI/CD platform is driven using Jenkins where it leverages [Serverless Framework](http://www.serverless.com) for deployment of serverless services.
* **SCM** - Jazz works with Gitlab as well as Bitbucket.


Jazz is [open-sourced](http://opensource.t-mobile.com) and under active development by T-Mobile's Cloud Center of Excellence.
